# Getting Started With Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform. They have a free tier but it requires your credit card. 
I've been on their free tier for 7 years now and haven't been charged anything. 
I only use it for research.

Note: You must have a Microsoft account to sign up for Azure. If you don't have one, you can create one during the sign-up process.

To sign up for Azure, follow these steps:
1.	[Visit the Azure Website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us):
	Open your web browser and go to the [Azure Sign-Up Page](https://signup.azure.com/).
2.	Start Free:
	Click on the Start free button to begin the sign-up process.
3.	Microsoft Account:
	If you already have a Microsoft account, sign in with your credentials.
	If you don't have a Microsoft account, click on Create one! to create a new account.
4.	Identity Verification:
	You will need to verify your identity using a phone number. 
	1. Enter your phone number and follow the instructions to receive a verification code. 
	1. It's smart to also to set up two-factor authentication for your account. This will require that you download their authenticator to your phone.


5.	Payment Information:
	Enter your payment information. Note that while Azure offers a free tier, you need to provide a credit card for identity verification and to cover any usage beyond the free tier.
6.	Agreement:
	Review and accept the Microsoft Azure agreement and privacy statement.
7.	Complete Sign-Up:
	Click on the Sign up button to complete the process.
